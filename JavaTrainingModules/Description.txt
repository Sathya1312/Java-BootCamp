1) What is class in java?
 	A class is a group of objects which have common properties. 
 	It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
 	
 	A class in Java can contain:
		Fields
		Methods
		Constructors
		Blocks
		Nested class and interface
 
 2) What is Method?
 
 In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.

	Advantage of Method:
		1) Code Reusability
		2) Code Optimization
		
 3) What is Constructor in java?
  
 	In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. 
 	At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

	It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

	Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

	It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, 
	Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
	
	Two types of Constructor:
	 	1. no-arg constructor
	 	2. parameterized constructor

 	Rules for creating Java constructor
	There are two rules defined for the constructor.

			1. Constructor name must be the same as its class name
			2. A Constructor must have no explicit return type
			3. A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
